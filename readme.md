Backend was given (repo: https://github.com/oknaAnko/Udemy-courses-backend), frontend (boilerplate, webpack configuration, api requests, modals, user and admin panel) I wrote with the instructor guidance, and from myself I added styling and errors handling.

## Status

This project is just an excercise to practise hooks, context, api requests, css modules. There are some improvements that can be done here.
